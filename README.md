Curved columnar keyboard with thumb cluster

Building a curved keyboard with staggared columns (aka columnar) and thumb clusters.
There are alrady keyboards like this out there (redox, manuform redox manuform, ergodox, ergowrap, etc etc)
but I want to build my own.
It's split and it's meant to be mirrored halves.
